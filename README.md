# Skynet

Hi all!
Welcome to Skynet! (i need a new name, this is temporarily on loan from Terminator)

### What is this project about?

I want to make some drones and send them around the world (even on other planets), but I have absolutely no idea how to do it, so for now I gather some information in my spare time...

I would like to work full-time but the current economic system doesn't allow sufficient intellectual serenity (aka I don't have time and money).

## Contribute
Pull requests are welcome

For now I'm looking for guides on how to create drones (VTOL flying wing), things like materials to use, better components, use of solar panels, etc... but new ideas are appreciated.
